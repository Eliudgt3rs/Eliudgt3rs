### About me

I am an indie software developer and entrepreneur with a dream to improve the standards of software used in Africa and around the world. I pland to achieve this by creating high-performance web applications that solve real-life everyday problems. As the lead of Dr Web Kenya, a sole proprietorship software development company founded in 2025, I actively build scalable and efficient solutions using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and other modern technologies like Firebase and AI. With a commitment to standard code practices, modern UI/UX principles, and agile development controls, I deliver tailored digital products that meet the evolving needs of businesses across various industries. My work emphasizes innovation, user friendliness, and long-term value, ensuring every project contributes to client success and growth.

- 💡🔬 I am also keen in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I continuously explore how intelligent systems can enhance user experience, automate workflows, and unlock new possibilities in software development. My goal is to integrate smart technologies into modern applications to create solutions that are not just functional—but predictive, adaptive, and transformative.
